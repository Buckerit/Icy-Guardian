Icy Guardian is a fun and exciting game where you (the player) are stranded in a monster-inhabited island. You must rebuild your time machine by 
collecting all 21 Ice Shards which will randomly spawn on the screen! However, the monsters love a good meal, so you have to dodge and shoot the 
wolves, the council of 4 wizards, and flying enemies that spawn in. Luckily you’ve been blessed with infinite bullets. You also have to try and collect
the randomly spawning Ice shards that spawn around the map. You win if you collect 21 shards! As time goes on, it gets harder to collect the shards as 
there would be more enemies that you have to deal with, due to the interval the enemy spawns decreases to make them spawn faster. You also have a 
chance to recover your health through the health power up that randomly spawns and moves across the window from the left, right, top or bottom.

HOW TO PLAY:
- WASD to move around
- There is a scoreboard that sorts the high scores in the game by clicking on the column headings in reverse and ascending
- Enter your name when you first load up the game
- Left-mouse click to shoot bullets every 0.4 seconds
- Avoid all and any entities or projectiles except for health power ups!
- Collect health power ups to gain lost health (max health possible is 3)
- Every wolf killed is 3 points, and every bat killed is 5 points towards the high score
- Reach 21 shards collected to build your time machine and escape!
- Save your high score at the end if you choose to do so

You start off the game by adding your name to the text widget. We will use this information to save your score on a new file if you choose to. 
This way you can check if you had a high score or not. You use “WASD” to move your character around the map and left-click to shoot the enemies. 
The wizards cannot be shot, as they are really strong spirits that have gained the ability to make bullets pass through them, making them omnipotent 
beings whose only purpose is to shoot. You can see your health bar on the top left of the screen. Your health decreases every time a wolf collides with 
the player, the bat collides with the player or whenever a wizard's orb collides with a player. You only have 3 hearts. The health power up gives you one
extra heart to play the game longer and eventually collect the 21 shards. After 7 shards are collected, the bats start spawning and tracking you. After
14 shards are collected, the wizards come in and will try to kill you with their orbs until you collect 21. Try to survive until then. If you simply 
want to go for a new high score, then don’t reach 21 shards, and make your score go as high as you want it to go.

Wolf: Simply runs around trying to bump into the player
Bat: Tracks the player’s location and flies specifically to the player after it has sensed that the player has collected 7 shards.
Wizard: The Final Boss. He will notice you’ve made the remarkable achievement of collecting 14 shards, and will try to kill you from afar using his seat-seeking orbs.
